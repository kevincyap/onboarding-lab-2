# Week 2 Lab: System Verilog

## Questions
### Why do you think the reason for these different testing approaches are? What are their advantages and disadvantages?
Testing for one example is quick and fast for simplistic components that don't require extensive testing for verifiying completness and makes overall testing faster for a project. \
Having a pre-determined set of test cases can provide a thorough test suite that targets specific components of a module and reduces testing time. These test cases must be specifically picked in order to properly test a module. \
Randomly picking test cases is a quick and easy method of testing the general functionality of module. If a module has limited edge cases simply trying random inputs is sufficient to test the functionality of a module.
